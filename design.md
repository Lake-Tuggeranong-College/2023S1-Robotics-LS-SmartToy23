When you say “what is the weather today?” the toy will display an animation of the weather and say the weather (eg. If it snows, the toy face will display a snow falling animation and say “it is 3 degrees outside and snowing, don't forget a warm coat!” sound and thermal

wave to wake the toy up. when there is no movement the light will be red. When you wave, the light will turn green. the button will then wave back.

button can say hi and be paired with wave back if it sees movement

if you move far away from the toy it will say bye bye (buzzer beeps twice) and wave for 5 seconds then go to sleep.

log everything

If the toy reaches the edge of a surface, it will stop itself using a line sensor.
