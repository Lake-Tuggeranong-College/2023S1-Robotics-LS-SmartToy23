It has a good bye function. If the crash sensor button is pressed, it will turn on the red light.

It has a music play function. If you put your hand to the sonar sensor, it will detect the movement and turn on the yellow light. It will also sound the piezo buzzer which changes based on how close the hand is to the sensor.
